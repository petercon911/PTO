#test.py is the main file
python test.py 0 0 0 0 # in order; generator, solver(HC then EA), teamsize(0 = 4, etc), random.seed
write to a file in a single line, tabulated, in this order; generator, solver, teamSize, runNo, budjet, solution, fitness, history, violations, costs
resultsPlot.py reads this data back, it is designed to go through both generators, solvers, teamsizes, seeds. can be modified in the file loops
reduces the objective, violation and cost history arrays to only when they change value and captures the location of the change
